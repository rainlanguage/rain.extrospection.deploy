/// `Build`'s NatSpec argues that "one list, three readers" makes a contract
/// silently absent from a release impossible. That is true of the readers
/// INSIDE `Build` — the regeneration, both lib writers and the freeze all read
/// `generatedContracts()` — and false of the boundary: what this repo deploys
/// is declared in `ExtrospectDeploySuites.candidateSuites()`, and the
/// generator's list is a second hard-coded array in a second file.
///
/// A candidate dropped from `generatedContracts()` by a refactor or a merge
/// still compiles, because its committed snapshot is still there and still
/// imported. `cutRelease()` then freezes only the contracts the generator
/// names, `regenerateLibs()` writes a released-suites lib only for those, and
/// the release permanently omits that contract. Nothing downstream can see it:
/// `testEveryFrozenSnapshotIsReleased` walks record -> declaration, so a record
/// entry never written is invisible to it, and `ExtrospectDeployChainTest` is
/// never handed the omitted suite. `SnapshotAlreadyFrozen` then makes the hole
/// unrepairable, because the tag has been cut.
///
/// So the agreement of the two lists is asserted here, along with the three
/// properties of the generator's own entries that decide which file each
/// contract's pins are written into.
///
/// Deliberately nothing here calls `run()` or `cutRelease()`. Both rewrite the
/// committed `src/generated/` snapshots and `src/lib/` libs that other test
/// contracts read, and forge runs test contracts in parallel — a contract
/// rewriting what another one is reading is a race, not a check. Nothing below
/// writes anything.
